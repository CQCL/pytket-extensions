# pytket-pyquil

[Pytket](https://cqcl.github.io/tket/pytket/api/index.html) is a Python module for interfacing
with CQC tket, a set of quantum programming tools.

Rigetti's [pyQuil](http://rigetti.com/forest) is a library for generating
programs in the Quil language and running them on the Forest platform.

`pytket-pyquil` is an extension to `pytket` that allows `pytket` circuits to be
run on Rigetti backends and simulators, as well as conversion to and from pyQuil
representations.

## Getting started

`pytket-pyquil` is available for Python 3.8, 3.9 and 3.10, on Linux, MacOS and
Windows. To install, run:

```pip install pytket-pyquil```
